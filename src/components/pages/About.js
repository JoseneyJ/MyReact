Greetings! My name is Joseney Jean Pierre and I am a recent graduate from the University of Miami's Coding Bootcamp!
My portfolio is currently under deep construction as you can see lol. Come back in 2 weeks and this page will really be a sight to see!
I currently have a Bachelor's in Psychology with a minor in Biology from Thee Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University. 
I currently work in Human Resources and decided to venture into the Software Engineering world for a better quality of life in terms of finanicial stability and I've fallen in love with it!
I want you to know that I planned to skip this assignment but decided to complete it because I am having issues deploying another one of my assignments so I decided to come back and work on this one just in case if I can't get the other assignment turned in. 
It took me about 2 hours to get this going just a few hours before it was due lol. I must say im beyond impressed that I was able to do all of this is just 2 hours!
